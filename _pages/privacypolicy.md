# Plantir Privacy Policy & Terms of use
I take the privacy of my users very seriously, and do not collect any personal information that is not necessary for the app’s functionality.

Plantir can access some information (photos) for use in the app.

No data from the app is sent back to me or collected in any way. I don’t even know anything about your use of the app unless you email me for support and give me information. All data collected or accessed by the app stays solely on device.

If you purchase Plantir Pro, your billing information, address, and name are kept by the App Store and are not accessible by me. The only information I have is whether or not you have purchased the app. This anonymous information is also collected by my purchase provider RevenueCat.

Feel free to email me at support@islandsprite.com if you have any questions.

# Personally Identifying Information
Plantir does not collect or send any Personally Identifying Information. Some data (photos, preferences, etc.) may be collected by the app and stored in iCloud if sync is enabled. In these cases, the data is used only for syncing and is not accessed or used otherwise.

# Privacy Policy Changes
Although any changes to the policy are likely to be small and inconsequential, Plantir may change it’s privacy policy at any time. Continued use of the app after any change in the Privacy Policy constitutes an acceptance of such change. If Plantir were acquired or any other large changes to the business occur, this Privacy Policy may be amended.

# Indemnity
You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
